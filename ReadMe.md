Instructions for the BMI Calculator:

1. In the environment of your choosing and with at least version 3.12.1 of python installed, use the `requirements.txt` to install pytest.
2. Make sure both files are located at the same directory, otherwise they cannot read from one another.
3. To run the BMI Calculator program on its own, use the command `python bmiCalculator.py`.
4. To run the unit tests, use the command `pytest bmiTest.py`
5. All tests should be successful to start with.
6. To induce the boundary shift, the code in the BMI Calculator would have to be modified to reproduce the report results. 
This can be achieved by loading the file in your favorite editor (personal choice is `micro` which works directly in the terminal)
and following the shift of the lower bound of Normal Weight from `18.5` to `18.4`.


A note on `Micro`:
If you wish to install this editor on Windows, you can do so via the command `winget install zyedidia.micro`
